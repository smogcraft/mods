# how to install

open a command terminal to your `.minecraft` folder and type
```git clone https://github.com/smogcraft/mods/```

**THIS REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE GIT INSTALLED**

**it is installed on macos and linux by default, but not on windows**

If you have a `mods` folder already, it wont work. do these steps:
1.  move the current mods folder out of `.minecraft` 
2.  run the above command
3.  put the folder you took out back into the `.minecraft` folder
4.  say yes to anything asking you to merge the folder

**these mods require fabric 1.16.5, so make sure to have those**

## congrats!
